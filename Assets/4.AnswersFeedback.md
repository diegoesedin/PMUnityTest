## Was the test interesting?
- Yes, it was quite interesting. I was very surprised about point one, I had never seen a Tool's exercise in a technical interview and it's interesting.

## What was the most challenging part of the test?
- I think the most challenging part was thinking and making the gameplay itself of points two and three. Those gameplays are really simple, but it was challenging make them in a short time and think of the best aproach to follow the guidelines.

## What would you like to change in the test?
- I would like to merge points two and three, I think I could show my knowledge following the two points but with less time doing just one game.

## Did you have enough time to accomplish the test?
- Yes, I did, but I have to say that it was difficult to complete it managing my personal time (because of work and home stuff). Anyways, I think that the short time is part of the challenge.
